An adjective is a word or set of words that modifies (i.e. describes) a noun or pronoun. Adjectives may come before or after the word they modify.

> _This is a **cute** cat. This cat is **cute**._

Adjectives tell us something about a person or a thing. Adjectives can modify nouns (e.g girl, boy etc.) or pronouns (e.g. we, it etc.).

> - _Lily is **an honest** person._
> - _The movie was **awful**! The plot is simply **boring.**_

There are many pairs of adjectives ending in `-ing` and `-ed`. Remember that if something is `-ing`, it makes you `-ed`.

> - _He is **exited** because the event is **exciting**._
> - _I am **annoyed** because this whole situation is **annoying**._

Sometimes we use two or more adjectives together. Quantity/number and quality/opinion adjectives usually go before fact adjectives.

| article | quantity |    quality    |         fact         |   noun    |
| :-----: | :------: | :-----------: | :------------------: | :-------: |
|    a    |          |    _nice_     |       _sunny_        | _morning_ |
|         |  _two_   | _intelligent_ |       _young_        | _ladies_  |
|    a    |          |  _beautiful_  | _large round wooden_ |  _table_  |

There are times when we use two or more fact adjectives. We put fact adjectives in the following order:

| article |  size  |   age   |  shape  | colour  | material | purpose  |  noun   |
| :-----: | :----: | :-----: | :-----: | :-----: | :------: | :------: | :-----: |
|    a    | _big_  |  _old_  | _round_ |         | _wooden_ |          | _table_ |
|         |        |  _new_  |         | _white_ |          | _tennis_ | _shoes_ |
|    a    | _tall_ | _young_ |         |         | _Polish_ |          |  _boy_  |

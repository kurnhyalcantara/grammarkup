We use modal verbs to show if we believe something is certain, probable or possible (or not). We use modals to ask permission, make request and offers etc.

Modal verbs fall into the category of auxiliary verbs. It means that they are used together with a main verb to give grammatical information and additional meaning to a sentence.

The modal verb `can` has only two forms: `can` (_present_) and `could` (past). We use the modal verb `can` and `the base form of the verb` to form sentences. Questions are formed by inverting the subject and `can`. Negatives are formed with `not`. Contracted forms are used (`can't`/`couldn't`).

We can use the modal:

| Can                                                                        | Could                                                                       | example                                                    |                                        |

| to request something (informal)                                            | to request something (formal)                                               | **Can** you help me, please?                               | **Could** you show me the way, please? |
| to make offers                                                             | to make suggestion                                                          | **Can** I carry these bags for you?                        | We **could** go to the bar if you want |

## Guided Practice

**Decide whether the verbs are being used as an auxiliary or main verb of the sentence.**

- His grandfather was a brave man. <InfoTooltip label="main verb" />
- The students were working on a group project. <InfoTooltip label="auxiliary verb" />

**Use the auxiliary verb _to be_ when you don't want to repeat something.**

- Ann's husband was happy about the upcoming job opportunity, but she .................... . She wanted to stay in L.A. <InfoTooltip label="wasn't" />

**Use the auxiliary verb _to be_ to deny something or say that it is not true.**

- The party was a disaster. - Not, it .................... . It was a blast! <InfoTooltip label="wasn't" />

**Use the auxiliary verb _to be_ to show interest in what somebody has said, or to show surprise.**

- Do you know that Samantha is moving abroad? - ....................? Are you sure? <InfoTooltip label="Is she?" />

**Use the auxiliary verb _to be_ with _so_ (when you agree) and _neither/nor_ (when you disagree). Remember that an auxiliary verb goes before the subject.**

- Jack is feeling uplifted. - .................... <InfoTooltip label="So is she." />
- I'm not happy about the news. - .................... <InfoTooltip label="Neither am I." />

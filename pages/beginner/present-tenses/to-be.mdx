To be is the most important verb that exists in the English language. So it's
important that you know how to conjugate it. To conjugate a verb means to change it
depending on who the subject is, who is doing the action. As well, with a lot of verbs we can
contract them, combine them to make a shorter form with the subject. This is a contraction. So, I will show you the contractions, as well as the long forms in positive and negative sentences.

### Positive Conjugation

In the positive, we have `I am`, `he is`, `she is`, `it is`, `we are`, `you are`, `they are`. We also have a short form. We contract or shorten these into something shorter.

- I am, _i'am_
- He is, _he's_
- She is, _she's_
- It is, _it's_
- We are, _we're_
- You are, _you're_
- They are, _they're_

### Negative Conjugation

> Conjugated 'to be' + Not

We use negative sentences a lot. So let's look at how we make to be negative and we'll look at the short form, the contraction that the negative has as well.

`I am not`. So we can see that not is how we make this verb negative, and in the short form, it's `I'm not`.

- He is not, _he's not_
- She is not, _she's not_
- It is not, _it's not_
- We are not, _we're not_
- You are not, _you're not_
- They are not, _they're not_

### When to Use Contractions

So when do we use the long form? and when do we use the short form? A couple reasons. First in spoken English, we like to make things shorter and easier to say so we contract that is we use short forms more often. It's just much more common in spoken english. So in spoken English the short form, the contracted form, is much more popular. In written English, especially in essays or your homework. We usually don't contract. We prefer the long form, unless you are writting in an informal way like with friends. And finally in spoken English, we do sometimes use the long form but really only when we want to emphasize something to stress it and focus on it a little bit more. As well, we also use it in very formal situations like an important work meeting or talking to your boss.

Let me give you some examples and you try to tell me why we're contracting using the short form and why sometimes we're not.

> I still can't find it. I told you **it is** over there

I didn't contract in the second sentence because it's for stress emphasis.

> Dear Sir or Madam. **It is** an honor to write you this letter.

Written English using a formal tone.

> Dude. **It's** so cool to finally meet you

This is spoken English and very informal so we contract.

> Mr. Parker, **I am** looking forward to watching your presentation this morning

Here we don't contract because it sounds very formal. It looks like it might be a writing too.

> No, the boss said **I am** responsible for it.
> What? **You are** responsible for the project now.

Here we are really stressing the subject putting emphasis.

### To be with things and people

Using to be with adjectives and when describing people. To be is very common and very important. We need to use it with adjectives and often when describing people like their age. Let's look at some examples.

**To be scared of something**

> He's scared of slipping on the ice

**To be sick**

> She's sick. So she won't be at work today

**To be an age**

> I'm 23 and my parents are both 51

Notice that in English we use to be with age not have or with.

> He's Brazilian and they're Indian.

> No, you misheard me. I said that I am too tired to go out tonight

> It's rainy today

> If you're hungry, we can go to a cafe!

Notice here, It's _to be hungry_ not _to have hunger_

### That/there/here + To be

We're going to look more at these later. But just to tell you right now how we contract them. We shorten them when followed by to be. And the rules about whether to use the long form or the short form are exactly the same if the situation is formal or informal in spoken English or if our writing is formal or informal. We also don't contract if we want to stress something to emphasize or point it out.

Here are some examples

> There's a new restaurant, do you want to eat there?

> There is your car over there!

> Here's my address. Look forward to seeing you.

> That's my son in the front

> Oh, here's the entrance

> Excuse me, sir and madam, but there is no more seating available. I am terribly sorry! Wait, there is more seating or there is not more seating, speak louder. I cant't hear you

Alright, so that was our introduction to the most important verb in English, to be. So go do the homework and keep practicing!

### Introduction

A subject is the person or thing that performs the action in the clause or sentence. A subject pronoun is a pronoun that takes the place of a noun as the subject of a sentence. For example:

> _**She** told me about her worries_

Subject pronouns replace nouns that are the subject of their clause. Look the following table:

|            |  Singular   | Plural |
| :--------: | :---------: | :----: |
| 1st person |     _I_     |  _we_  |
| 2nd person |    _you_    | _you_  |
| 3rd person | _he/she/it_ | _they_ |

We should replace the subject with a subject pronoun to avoid repetition.

> _~~Mary is a student and Mary is very hard working~~_. _Mary is a student and she is very hard working_

We use the subject pronoun _it_ when we refer to objects, things, animals, or ideas.

> _Love is eternal. **It** will last forever_

Sometimes when we don't know the sex of a baby, we can use _it_.

> _Their baby is so small. **it** only weights 2 kilos_

We use _it_ when we talk about time, weather, or temperature.

> _What time is it? - **It's** 7 o'clock_. _It's quite cold today_.

### Short Story using Subject Pronouns

-Shall **we** go out tonight? The weather is lovely!

-Yes, **it** is! Maybe **we** could go for a walk? **I** don't feel like eating.

-**It**'s strange. Are **you** feeling well?

-**I**'m alright, thank you. I was at my grandma's today and **she** cooked a lot of stuff for lunch. **I** felt like **I** was about to explode!

-**I** know the feeling! All grandmas are like that. **They** show their love by feeding their grandkids.

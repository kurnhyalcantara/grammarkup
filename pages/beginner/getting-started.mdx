### Code and Syntax Highlighting

Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.

```javascript
var s = 'JavaScript syntax highlighting'
alert(s)
```

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```

```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting.
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.
```

```bash
npx create-next-app
```

```css
body {
  font-family: Camphor, Open Sans, Segoe UI, sans-serif;
  text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;
  -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
  -moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;
}
```

### Blockquotes

> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.
> This line is part of the same quote.

Quote break.

> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can _put_ **Markdown** into a blockquote.

Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           |   Cool |
| ------------- | :------------ | -----: |
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | \$1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   \$12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    \$1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

| Markdown | Less      | Pretty     |
| -------- | --------- | ---------- |
| _Still_  | `renders` | **nicely** |
| 1        | 2         | 3          |

A preposition is usually a short word used to link nouns, pronouns, or phrases to other words within a sentence.

> _If I'm not mistaken, her birthday is **in** May._

Prepositions do not change their form.

> _I want (What?) **to** go (Where?) **to** the movies._ (=I had a desire **to** go **to** the movies.)

Prepositions can consist of one, two, or more words.

> - _Josh went **to** the club **instead of** studying for his exams._
> - _There was a huge traffic jam **in front of** us._

Prepositions can be divided into the following categories:

- **prepositions of place** state the positions or location of one thing with another.

> _Kate works **at** Starbucks._

- **prepositions of time** denote specific time periods.

> _We usually go to our relatives **at** Christmas._

- **prepositions of direction** or motion indicate movement from one place to the other.

> _There's a great pub **across** the street._

- **prepositions of manner** express the manner in which something is done.

> _You can't achieve success **by** doing nothing._

- **prepositions of cause, purpose, and reason** indicate why, what for, or because of what something happens.

> _She couldn't attend the meeting **due to** some family issues._

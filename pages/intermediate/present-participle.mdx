---

Most commonly we use the present participle `-ing` as an element in all continuous verb forms (the present continuous, the past continuous etc.).

The auxiliary verb indicated the tense, while the present participle remains unchanging.

> _**I was playing** computer games all night._ (past continuous)

The present participle if formed by adding `-ing` to the base form of the verb.

- Verbs ending in `-e` drop `-e` and add `-ing`.

> - _like - liking_
> - _write - writing_

- Verbs with one syllable, ending in one vowel and one consonant, double the consonant and add `-ing`.

> - _sit - sitting_
> - _swim - swimming_

- Verbs ending `-ie` change `-ie` to `-y` and add `-ing`.

> - _lie - lying_
> - _die - dying_

The present participle is used not only fo form verb tenses. It can be used:

- after verbs of movement and position (often after the verb `to go`)

> - _She went **shopping**._
> - _They came **running** towards me._

- after verbs of perception in the pattern `verb` + `object` + `present participle` to indicate the action being perceived.

> - _We saw him **mowing** the lawn._
> - _Liz heard someone **singing**_

- after verbs of movement, action, or position to indicated parallel activity.

> - _He sat **looking** at the pedestrians._
> - _July walks **reading** her newspaper._

- as an adjective.

> - _Have you heard of that **amazing** movie?_
> - _The family was trapped inside the **burning** barn._

- to explain the cause or reason. The present participle is used instead of a phrase starting with `as`, `since`, `because`.

> - _**Feeling** hungry, I made myself a sandwich._ (=I made myself a sandwich **because** I was hungry.)
> - _**Knowing** that his roommate was coming, James cleaned the living room._ (=James cleaned the living room **as** he knew that his roommate was coming.)

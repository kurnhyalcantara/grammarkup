title: Must - May - Might
description: We use the future continuous to say that we will be in the middle of doing something at certain time in the future.
---

We use modal verbs to show if we believe something is certain, probable or possible (or not). We also use modals to ask permission, make requests and offers etc.

Modal verbs fall into the category of auxiliary verbs (also known as _helping verbs_). It means that they are used together with a main verb to give grammatical information and additional meaning to a sentence.

We use the modal verb `must` and _the base form of the verb_ to form sentences. Questions are formed by inverting the subject and `must`. Negatives are formed with `not`. Contracted forms are used (mustn't).

We can use the modal verb `must`:

- **to express obligation, duty, or prohibition (this also refers to laws and regulations)**

> - _You **must** wear a seatbelt at all times._
> - _You **mustn't** use your smartphone while driving._

- **to emphasize the necessity of something.**

> _People **must** drink a lot of water during the day._

- **to express our certainty in something being true.**

> - _Look! There are puddles everywhere. **It must have rained**._
> - _You are still working? **You must be tired!**_

- **to give a strong recommendation.**

> _You **must** listen to this song, it's so catchy!_

We also use the future continuous to say that something will definitely happen in the future.

> _I'll **be going** to the shop later. Can I get you anything?_

Compare `will be doing` with the other continuous forms.

> - _Jane has an ordinary 9/5 job._
> - _At 11 o'clock yesterday she was working._ (past continuous)
> - _At 11 o'clock today she is working._ (present continuous)
> - _**At 11 o'clock tomorrow she will be working**._ (future continuous)

## Guided Practice

**Use _will_ + _be_ + _-ing_ form of the verb to make sentences in the future continuous.**

- It'll be busy morning for me. I (to cook), I (to clean), I (to wash) the dishes, and I (to get) my siblings ready for school. <InfoTooltip label="It'll be a busy morning for me. I'll be cooking, I'll be cleaning, I'll be washing the dishes, and I'll be getting my siblings ready for school." />

**Form questions by inverting the subject and _will_. Forms negatives with will not (won't) _be_ + _-ing_ form of the verb. Use contracted forms.**

- Why (you/to work) on your project that late? - Well, I (not to work) on it alone at least. <InfoTooltip label="Why will you be working on your project that late? - Well, I won't be working on it alone at least." />

**Find time markers.**

- In one year's time I will be travelling across Europe. <InfoTooltip label="one year's time" />

**Use the future continuous to say that something will definitely happen in the future.**

- You can't take my laptop. I (to use) it during my presentation today. <InfoTooltip label="I'll be using it during my presentation today." />

**Note the difference between _will be doing_ and the other continuous forms.**

- Yesterday I (to wait) for my paycheck, and tomorrow I (to go) on a cruise. <InfoTooltip label="Yesterday I was waiting for my paycheck, and tomorrow I will be going on a cruise." />

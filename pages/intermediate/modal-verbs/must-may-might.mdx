We use modal verbs to show if we believe something is certain, probable or possible (or not). We also use modals to ask permission, make requests and offers etc.

Modal verbs fall into the category of auxiliary verbs (also known as _helping verbs_). It means that they are used together with a main verb to give grammatical information and additional meaning to a sentence.

We use the modal verb `must` and _the base form of the verb_ to form sentences. Questions are formed by inverting the subject and `must`. Negatives are formed with `not`. Contracted forms are used (`mustn't`).

We can use the modal verb `must`:

- **to express obligation, duty, or prohibition (this also refers to laws and regulations)**

> - You **must** wear a seatbelt at all times.
> - You **mustn't** use your smartphone while driving.

- **to emphasize the necessity of something.**

> People **must** drink a lot of water during the day.

- **to express our certainty in something being true.**

> Look! There are puddles everywhere. **It must have rained** <br />
> You are still working? **You must be tired!**

- **to give a strong recommendation.**

> You **must** listen to this song, it's so catchy!

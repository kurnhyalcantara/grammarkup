title: Past Continuous
description: We use the past continuous when we describe a situation, or several situations in progress, happening at the same time in the past
---

We use the past continuous when we describe a situation, or several situations in progress, happening at the same time in the past. This is often contrasted with a sudden event in the past simple.

> _[I **was working** on my computer and my brother **was reading** a book] [when we heard a loud bang on the door]._ (1 - background situation; 2 - sudden event)

The past continuous is formed with **the past form of the auxiliary verb to be** and **the -ing form of the main verb**. Questions are formed by inverting the subject and the auxiliary verb `to be`. Negatives are formed with the auxiliary verb `to be` + `not`. This is contracted in speech and informal writing.

> - _(+) Jim **was playing** video games all night._
> - _(-) Jim **was not playing** video games all night./He **wasn't playing** video games all night._
> - _(?) **Was Jim **playing video games all night? **Why was** he **playing** video games all night?_

Some time markers can emphasize the duration of the action or state when the action was taking place. These time markers are `at 7 o'clock`, `for two hours`, `in January`, `last week`, `all night` etc.

> _Kate was trying to find a nice apartment in her area **for 5 months**._

We can use `when` or `while` with the past continuous to mean "during the time that".

> - _**While** they were waiting for the train, it started to rain._
> - _James broke his finger **when** he was playing basketball._

Remember that **non-continuous verbs** (e.g to love, hate, know, want etc.) are not used in any continuous tenses. Use the past simple instead.

> - _~~I was having fun at the party, but Kim was wanting to go home~~. I was having fun at the party, but **Kim wanted to go home**._

## Guided Practice

**We use the past continuous when we describe a situation, or several situations in progress, happening at the same time in the past. This is often contrasted with a sudden event in the past simple. **

- [While Emily was cooking dinner], [the phone rang]. <InfoTooltip label="[1] - background event; [2] - sudden event" />

**Use the past form of _to be_ and the _-ing_ form of the main verb to make sentences in the past continuous.**

- Mike (to paint) the walls in the living room, Ann (to play) with her toys there, Helen (to get) ready for a date, and Nancy (to take) pictures of that busy evening. <InfoTooltip label="Mike was painting the walls in the living room, Ann was playing with her toys there, Helen was getting ready for a date, and Nancy was taking pictures of that busy evening." />

**Form questions by inverting the subject and _to be_. Forms negatives with _to be_ + _not_. Use contracted forms.**

- What (you to do) at 7 p.m. yesterday? - I (not to celebrate) my friend's b-day like I wanted to. I (to help) my boss at work instead. <InfoTooltip label="What were you doing at 7 p.m. yesterday? - I wasn't celebrate my friend's b-day like I wanted to. I was helping my boss at work instead." />

**Find time markers.**

- It was snowing heavily yesterday. I was making snowmen with my kids the whole day. <InfoTooltip label="yesterday, the whole day" />

**Use _when_ or _while_.**

- Peter fell asleep .................... he was watching TV. <InfoTooltip label="when" />

description: Concrete nouns are tangible and you can experience them with your five senses

A concrete noun is a noun that can be identified through one of the five senses: touch, sight, hearing, smell, or taste.

> - _Who turned off the **TV**?_ (The noun TV is a concrete one.)
> - _What is that **noise**?_ (Even though noise can’t be touched, you can hear it, so it’s a concrete noun.)

Concrete nouns fall into several categories:

- **people** -- mother, friend, teacher, stranger etc.

- **places** -- school, McDonald's, Las Vegas, India etc.

- **things you can touch and see** -- plane, cup, lamp, book etc.

- **things you can hear** -- music, noise, someone’s voice, song etc.

- **things you can smell and taste** -- herbs, cookies, bread, wine etc.

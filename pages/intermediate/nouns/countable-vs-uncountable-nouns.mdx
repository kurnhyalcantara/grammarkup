Nouns can be countable or countable. Study the following table and learn the differences between countable and uncountable nouns.

1. **Countable Nouns**

- Things that can be counted, even if the number might be extremely high (e.g. all the people in the world).

- Can be singular or plural.

> _I have an **apple** and you have three **apples**._

- You can use `a`/`an` with singular countable nouns.

> _There is **a girl** outside. She is wearing **a beautiful dress**._

- If you want to ask about the quantity of a countable noun, you ask ‘How many?’ combined with the plural countable noun.

> _**How many dogs** are there? – There are **five dogs**._

- You can use many, a few, few with plural countable nouns.

> _Sorry, but I didn’t take **many pictures**. I’ve got a **few relatives** leaving here._

2. **Uncountable Nouns**

- to talk about general abilities or skill in the past.

> _I **could** paint beautifully as a kid _

- to make general statements about what was possible/impossible (not allowed)

> - _It **could** be very hot in summer._
> - _He **couldn't** do it! He is such a sweet guy._

- to ask permission (formal)

> _**Could** I use your phone, please? _

- to request something (formal)

> _**Could** you show me the way, please?_

- to make suggestion

> _We **could** go to the bar if you want._

## Guided Practice

**Material nouns denote a material or substance from which things are made of. These nouns do not have a plural form and articles are not used with them.**

- ~~Have you seen my rubbers gloves?~~ <InfoTooltip label="Have you seen my rubber gloves?" />

**Material nouns can denote things related to nature, animals, and plants. Spot these nouns.**

- My ideal breakfast would consist of bacon and eggs and a glass of milk sitting somewhere at the beach, breathing fresh air, and enjoying life. <InfoTooltip label="bacon, eggs, milk, air" />

**Material nouns can denote artificial or man-made materials. Spot these nouns.**

- Do you think that Alice will like this perfume? I don't know if she'll like its sweet scent. <InfoTooltip label="perfume"/>

**A compound noun contains two or more words which are joined together and form a single noun. The first word usually describes or modifies the second word, denoting its type or purpose. Consequently, the second word identifies the item itself.**

- a .................... (a machine used for washing laundry) <InfoTooltip label="washing machine"/>
- a .................... (a person who watches what is happening without taking part) <InfoTooltip label="bystander"/>

**There is no exact rule as to when we should write compound nouns together, hyphenated, or as separate words, thus you always need to consult a dictionary.**

- Helen lvoes going to the (swimmingpool) .................... in summer. < InfoTooltip label="swimming pool (separated)"/>
- (checkin) .................... and baggage (dropoff) .................... for most flight opens 2 hours before the scheduled departure time. <InfoTooltip label="Check-in, drop-off (hyphenated)"/>
- I don't let my kids eat in their (bedrooms) .................... . <InfoTooltip label="bedrooms (written together)"/>

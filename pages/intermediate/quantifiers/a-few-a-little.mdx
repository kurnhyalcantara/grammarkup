description: The possessive form is used with nouns referring to people, groups of people, countries, and animals.

Quantifiers are adjectives and adjectival phrases that give approximate or specific answers to the questions `How much?` and `How many?`.

> _Sorry, but there isn’t **much** left for you to do here._

To answer the questions `How much?` and `How many?` certain quantifiers can be used with countable nouns (chairs, apples), while others can be used with uncountable nouns (tea, money).

> - _How **many** cousins do you have?_ (countable)
> - _How **much** money did you spend?_ (uncountable)

Note that `how much` can also be used when we want to know the price of something. In this case, we can use `how much` with countable nouns (both singular and plural nouns).

> _How **much** does this dress cost?_

`A few`, `a little`, (very) `few`, and (very) `little` are generally used in affirmative statements, not negatives or questions.

Look at the following table demonstrating the differences between a few, a little, (very) few, and (very) little.

## Guided Practice

**To form possessive, add an apostrophe + _-s_ to the noun.**

- The (baby) .................... clothes should be washed regularly. <InfoTooltip label="baby's" />

**If the noun already ends in _-s_, just add an apostrophe.**

- Your (parents) .................... signatures are not needed in this case. <InfoTooltip label="parents'" />

**For names ending in _-s_, you can either add an apostrophe + _-s_, or just an apostrophe. Note that the first option is more common.**

- I like (Adams) .................... style of writing. <InfoTooltip label="Adams's"/>

**Study some of the fixed expressions where the possessive form is used.**

- Jim needs more than a (month) .................... pay to cover his expenses. <InfoTooltip label="month's"/>

**Note that the possessive is also used to refer to shops, restaurants, churches, universities etc., using the name or job title of the owner.**

- Some people do not agree with (Facebook) .................... new privacy policy. <InfoTooltip label="Facebook's"/>

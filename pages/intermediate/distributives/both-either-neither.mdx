Distributives determiners or simply distributives refer to a gruop of people or things, and to individual members of the group. They show different ways of looking at the individuals within a group, and they express how something is distributed, shared, or divided.

> _**Both of us** like Mexican food._

## Both

`Both` refers to the whole pair and is equivalent to "one and the other". `Both` can be used with plural nouns on its own, or it can be followed by `of`, with or without an article. When followed by a plural pronoun, `both` must be separated from the pronoun by `of`.

> - _**Both (of) my parents** approve of me going to college._
> - _I told **both of them** to give me a call._

`Both` cannot be used with singular nouns, because it refers to two things.

> - _~~Both my sister likes travelling~~. Both my sisters like travelling._

## Either

`Either` is positive and when used alone refers to one of the two members of the pair. It is equivalent to "one or the other". Because it refers to just one member of a pair, `either` must be used before a singular noun. It can also be used with a plural noun or pronoun if followed by `of`.

> - _**Either day** is fine._
> - _We could stay at **either of the hotels**._

`Either` can also be used with `or` in a construction that talks about each member of the pair in turn. The meaning remains the same, but in this case `either` is not functioning as a distributive. It is functioning as a conjunction.

> _You can have **either** ice cream **or** cake._

## Neither

`Neither` is negative and when used alone refers to the whole pair. It is equivalent to "not one or the other". Because it refers to just one member of a pair, `neither` must be used before a singular noun. It can also be used with a plural noun or pronoun if followed by `of`.

> - _**Neither date** is convenient for me._
> - _**Neither of these dresses** suits her._

`Neither` can also be used with `nor` in a construction that talks about each member of the pair in turn. The meaning remains the same, but in this case `neither` is not functioning as a distributive. It is functioning as a conjunction.

> _It is **neither** snowing **nor** raining._
